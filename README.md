### Frontend Engineer Application

### 🔧 Tech stack used:

- ⚛️ **Next Js / React Js / Typescript**
- 💄 **Sass** for styles

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 📁 About the scaffolding

I decided to go with the typical `src/components` scaffolding, then inside of each component I added 2 files:

- The actual component, in a named `.tsx` file.
- The styles for this component, in a `.scss` file.

There are some other folders inside of src:

- The `context` folder contains the context/provider with its actions and hooks.
- A `types` folder containing some types that were used in multiple files across the project.

### 🎨 The styles

I tried to stick with the **BEM** naming convention.
I kept some general rules and mixins inside of `src/app/page.scss`

### 📝 How it works

This is an web app in which a user can easily schedule activities by clicking on the purple buttons and selecting the chosen information.
The information is saved in the local storage so that when the page is reloaded, the data of the already scheduled activities is still saved.
The user has the ability to:

- Create new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks.
